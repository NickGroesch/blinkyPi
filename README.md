# blinkiPi

This is a repository of experimental scripts involving the raspberry pi and my quite fledgling electronic ability. 

There are:

1. all kinds of scripts to make gpios blink
1. seven segment display stuff
1. musings related to my pi camera work, which is mostly in my **kds** repo
1. stats scripts often run in rc.local for the tiny oled display
1. sensor test scripts
1. ***the MOTOFLASK***
1. little bits of solder everywhere

## ***the MOTOFLASK***

You'll like this one: there are microservices! Witness a react front end manipulating svg components to create a realistic joystick interface to a flask backend controlling the battery powered, which masks an iframe that loads from a (rc) socketserver process. Better than DS, when my laptop serve react to my phone which I use to drive the pi tank around the office. Peruse. Enjoy. Tinker. That's what I do here.
